### Summary
This application emphasizes the use of Jquery to provide a simple planner application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. In this application, we have used the Moment.js library to work with date and time. This planner app, loops through the typical business hours at current date and allows the user to enter and save their plan into any description field that has a class of future. Also, the localStorage of the browser is used to store the data. The past hours are highlighted gray, the current hour red, and future hours green.

* Save Button
    * This allows the user to save their plan at a specific business hour in a local storage.

* Local Storage 
    * It is used to store the user's plan at specific time. The set and get methods are used to store and fetch the data from local storage respectively.
    
* Color-coded
    * The three colors are used to indicate the past, present and future event. Grey color indicates that time is past, red indicates that the time is present and green shows that time is future.

### Project Requirements
  * WHEN the user opens the planner THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
  * WHEN the user scroll down THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
  * WHEN the user view the time blocks for that day THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
  * WHEN the user clicks into a time block THEN I can enter an event
  * WHEN the user clicks the save button for that time block THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
  * WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the saved events persist
